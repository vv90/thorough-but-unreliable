# Development container

`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` uses the development image built by this
repository's flake and pinned inputs. Development is performed inside this
container, including Rust tests, Nix evaluation, and non-VM package builds.
Host-side experiment runners execute through sandboxed `nix build`.

## Development image settings

- Image reference: `localhost/thorough-but-unreliable-dev:latest`. Use the
  `latest` tag for now; rebuild, load and recreate after image changes.
- The development image includes the Rust compiler, Cargo, rustfmt, Clippy and
  rust-analyzer from the flake's pinned Nixpkgs revision.
- A dedicated Codex state volume is persisted; no tool-cache volumes are added.
  No full home, host caches, host credentials, runtime sockets or devices are mounted.
  The source checkout is deliberately writable.

## Build and load

From the repository root, on the host or designated builder with Nix and
rootless Podman:

```sh
nix build .#devImage
podman load < result
```

Nix creates `result` as a symlink to the image archive in the Nix store. Podman
loads that archive as `localhost/thorough-but-unreliable-dev:latest`, matching the
devcontainer configuration. Then open or recreate the devcontainer in your
editor; loading an image does not update an existing container.

Repeat the build/load commands after image changes, then recreate the container.
Build/load automation and image-identity recording are deferred. Run these
commands explicitly, not from a devcontainer lifecycle hook.

The memory limits (8 GiB RAM, 10 GiB total RAM+swap) are initial examples. Adjust
them to system RAM and other workloads; GPU VRAM is unrelated. Verify rootless
cgroup limits on the actual host.

## Persistent Codex state

The named Podman volume `thorough-but-unreliable-codex` mounts at
`/home/dev/.codex`. It retains credentials, configuration and local conversation
state across container recreation. It is not a mount of the host's Codex home.
Keep this name stable to reuse the state; choose another name for an unrelated
project or an independent checkout that should not share it.

The image prepares this directory with mode 0700 and UID/GID 1000 ownership,
and a writable mode-0600 `config.toml` containing
`cli_auth_credentials_store = "file"`. Podman's initial volume copy populates
a new volume. Existing volumes retain their own files: rebuilding the image
does not replace their configuration or repair their permissions.

After building/loading the image and attaching, check and sign in:

```sh
test -w /home/dev/.codex
stat -c '%u:%g %a %n' /home/dev/.codex /home/dev/.codex/config.toml
codex login
codex login status
```

Recreate the container with the same volume and run `codex login status` again
to verify persistence. File-backed credentials are supported by the
[official Codex authentication documentation](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/auth).
Revoking a login requires reauthentication but does not delete this volume's
configuration or local threads. Deleting the volume does remove that state.

Credentials are created only at login, never baked into the image or Nix store.
Other programs running as `dev` can read them; directory permissions do not
isolate programs sharing that user. Do not attach this volume to runtime harness
or experiment VMs. Treat backups as sensitive and manage retention explicitly.
Check volume ownership and login persistence when provisioning a new instance;
rebuilding the image does not validate or modify an existing volume.

## Private Nix installation

Nix runs locally as `dev` (UID/GID 1000). The image enables `includeNixDB` to
register included store closures and their GC roots. Image store paths and
database directories belong to that user. `NIX_REMOTE=local` selects the private
store rather than a daemon. Flakes and `nix-command` are enabled.

Both `/nix/store` and `/nix/var/nix` live in the container writable layer. They
survive stopping/restarting that instance but are reset on recreation. No host
store, database, Nix daemon socket or additional Nix volume is mounted. Do not
mount an empty volume over only one half of this initialized store/database.

No additional binary cache, substituter, signing key or cache service is
configured. Nix retains its default public cache configuration. HTTPS CA paths
are supplied for Nix and SSL-aware clients.

Interactive `nix eval`, `nix develop`, package builds and non-VM checks can run
inside the container. The configuration explicitly sets `sandbox = false` and
an empty build-users group for this restricted single-user development setup.
These commands remain inside the Podman boundary but do not receive a second
Nix build sandbox. Authoritative sandboxed builds and KVM integration remain on
the external runner. Do not add container privileges to make those work here.

After building and attaching, verify:

```sh
nix --version
nix config show sandbox
nix config show substituters
test -w /nix/store
test -w /nix/var/nix/db
nix eval --raw .#packages.x86_64-linux.devImage.name
nix develop --command bash --version
```

Then perform a small package build and confirm the resulting path is registered
in the private store. These are checks for a new instance; package builds and
Rust development already run in the current devcontainer.

## Deployment-specific checks and remaining work

- Verify HTTPS with Nix, curl and the agent; some clients use their
  own certificate-discovery rules. Do not disable TLS verification.
- Check editor server requirements when changing editors or hosts; host-distro
  library paths may not exist in this Nix userspace.
- Codex is supplied by the pinned Nixpkgs revision.
  Only its dedicated state directory is persisted, not all of `/home/dev`.
- Networking is the runtime default. It does not block host/LAN access. A
  dedicated host-managed network and policy are separate deployment work.
- Editor credential/SSH-agent forwarding must be disabled or explicitly scoped
  in editor settings and verified in the resulting container.
- Authoritative package checks and VM integration run externally against a
  recorded source snapshot, without exposing host Nix/libvirt/Podman sockets.
- Add scoped cache volumes only when their benefit justifies persistence, then
  decide their retention and quotas.

Editing these definitions does not update a running container. Rebuild, load,
and recreate it to apply image changes.
